had to change the name bc i had to do this multiple times 


Challenge 1 (Collatz Conjecture):

Used a while loop because the number of iterations is unknown.

The loop continues until the number reaches 1, applying rules based on even/odd values.

Each number in the sequence is printed, and a step counter tracks how many steps it took.

Challenge 2 (Prime Number Checker):

Used a for loop since the range of possible divisors (2 to n-1) is known.

The loop checks if any number divides evenly into the input.

If a divisor is found, it reports the number is not prime; otherwise, it confirms it's prime.

Challenge 3 (Multiplication Table Grid):

Used nested for loops to generate a 10x10 multiplication table.

The outer loop iterates through rows (1 to 10); the inner loop calculates and prints the products for each column.

Used formatted printing for alignment and readability.

AI Assistance:

Used ChatGPT to clarify logic, syntax, and formatting.

Did not use AI to generate core algorithms.

Usage complies with the course policy (allowed for concept clarification and debugging help only).
